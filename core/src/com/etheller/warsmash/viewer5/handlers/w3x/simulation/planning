/**
Creates its own timer and triggers when it expires.


@note The table below shows how often `TriggerRegisterTimerEvent` aka
`TriggerRegisterTimerEventPeriodic` is executed per second with different
timeout values set.
This is in comparison with a 1ms and 0ms `timer`.

Note how its frequency was limited to 100 times per second in v1.32.x.
